		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			This d3 force layout represents the most common two-word phrases in this
			sampling of presidential speeches. Each phrase is tied to the speech it is
			from, which is in turn tied to the President who gave the speech.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sentiment was done on the phrases shown here if they appeared more than
			three times in a single speech. Supervised machine learning was performed
			on a relatively small data set of politically speeches; using this data as
			a primary source for any research is not recommended.
